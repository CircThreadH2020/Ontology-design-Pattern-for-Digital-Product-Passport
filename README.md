# Digital Product Passport Ontology

This repository contains the ontology developed for the Digital Product Passport (DPP), with a primary focus on supporting Circular Economy through R-strategies. The ontology design is based on modular **Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs)** and aims to provide a standardized framework for managing product information throughout its lifecycle, specifically in the context of sustainability and resource efficiency.

## Use Case: Damaged Product Assessment by Recycler

The ontology is inspired by the **CircThread Project deliverable 6.3** and is specifically tailored to address the use case of **Damaged Product Assessment by Recycler**. This use case focuses on assessing damaged products in order to optimize recycling, reuse, or repair operations—key aspects of the Circular Economy's R-strategies.

### R-Strategies of Circular Economy

The R-strategies framework, central to Circular Economy, includes various approaches aimed at increasing product longevity and resource efficiency. These include e.g.:

- **Reuse**: Extending product life by reusing it or its components.
- **Recycle**: Recovering materials from products to reintroduce them into the production cycle.
- **Repair**: Fixing products to extend their functionality.

## Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs)

The ontology is composed of several **Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs)**, which are reusable solutions to common modeling problems. These ODPs provide flexibility and scalability, allowing the ontology to be extended and adapted to different use cases and domains within the Circular Economy.

### Key Features

- Modular and reusable **Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs)**.
- Support for various R-strategies of Circular Economy.
- Tailored to the **Damaged Product Assessment by Recycler** use case.
- Designed to promote sustainability and resource efficiency.

## Installation

To install and use the ontology, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dpp-ontology.git
   ```

2. Load the ontology into your preferred ontology editor (e.g., Protégé).

## Usage

Once the ontology is loaded, you can start exploring the R-strategies and how they are modeled. The ontology can be integrated with other systems to track product lifecycles, assess repairability, and manage recycling processes.
